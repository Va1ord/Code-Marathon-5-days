# Code-Marathon-5-days
Hello everyone!
I decided to participate in a 5-day code marathon. Preparations are underway today.
Most likely, for the variety of platforms, I will publish the project and codes not on GitHub, but on CodePen. I will comment on further actions here (opinions, changes, additional features).
And most likely I will not post the code files here. Only a link to my CodePen in the file.
I actually wanted to participate in the marathon about 10 days ago, but I had some other things to do and some website issues.
These will be some of the first projects on the web. I will record each project in a separate block
**/
Can I create a miniapp in the new MAX messenger?
/**

  First day - Ð¡arts.
So, the first marathon project has been completed!
I've added a file with a link to my CodePen. I'll post a feature on CodePen later.
I've added an additional feature that allows you to reset the slides when you click on the background.

  Second day - Drag and Drop.
The second project of the marathon has already been uploaded to CodePen
