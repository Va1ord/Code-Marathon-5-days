# Code-Marathon-5-days
Hello everyone!
I decided to participate in a 5-day code marathon. Preparations are underway today.
Most likely, for the variety of platforms, I will publish the project and codes not on GitHub, but on CodePen. I will comment on further actions here (opinions, changes, additional features).
And most likely I will not post the code files here. Only a link to my CodePen in the file.
I actually wanted to participate in the marathon about 10 days ago, but I had some other things to do and some website issues.
These will be some of the first projects on the web. I will record each project in a separate block

Can I create a miniapp in the new MAX messenger?
/**

  First day - Ð¡arts.
So, the first marathon project has been completed!
I've added a file with a link to my CodePen. I'll post a feature on CodePen later. 
I've added an additional feature that allows you to reset the slides when you click on the background.

  Second day - Drag and Drop.
The second project of the marathon has already been uploaded to CodePen.

  Third day - Slaider.
I have now added some css lines to the projects.
The third project is done
So, Day 3 is coming to an end.
I have added some functions to slider. (1:05)
I have now added a function that allows you to switch slides using buttons.
Chack new changes!

  Fourth day - Board.
The fourth project is already on CodePen, but the day is not over yet =>
I have added a function that allows you to switch slides using buttons < >

  Fifth day - Aim Traning.
It's actually the Fourth day.
No you didn't oversleep the day. I made the decision to shorten the marathon and the fifth project is already on my CodePen.
You can offer a CS2 player to test aim training.
Now, when you click on the circle, different colors will appear

When someone views my projects, I'll post a few additional features
I'll post my opinion on the projects later.
I have added some functions to Aim Training. (1:09)
Added the "Play Again" button.


  So, the 5-day marathon is coming to an end. Today, I've been improving my projects. If I make any changes, I'll post updates on github. (I'm not saying goodbye yet.)
