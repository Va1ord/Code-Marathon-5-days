# Code-Marathon-5-days
Hello everyone!
I decided to participate in a 5-day code marathon. Preparations are underway today.
Most likely, for the variety of platforms, I will publish the project and codes not on GitHub, but on CodePen. I will comment on further actions here (opinions, changes, additional features).
And most likely I will not post the code files here. Only a link to my CodePen in the file
