# Code-Marathon-5-days
Hello everyone!
I decided to participate in a 5-day code marathon. Preparations are underway today.
Most likely, for the variety of platforms, I will publish the project and codes not on GitHub, but on CodePen. I will comment on further actions here (opinions, changes, additional features).
And most likely I will not post the code files here. Only a link to my CodePen in the file.
I actually wanted to participate in the marathon about 10 days ago, but I had some other things to do and some website issues.
These will be some of the first projects on the web. I will record each project in a separate block
**/
Can I create a miniapp in the new MAX messenger?
/**
I think I can do that, but what about finding bugs (would it be more interesting)?
Oh, right - you can't comment on this. Good night.
I think it would be more interesting to work with Telegram bots due to the latest update.
See you soon
Some bot concepts have become very popular on Telegram. (I can tell you more if you're interested)
Can I make another bot in Telegram?
It was actually interesting to create different projects.
I'm considering creating multiple bots at once
See you soon
I would like to participate in more similar code marathons. I have created a new repository with a Telegram bot, so you can watch it now

  First day - Ð¡arts.
So, the first marathon project has been completed!
I've added a file with a link to my CodePen. I'll post a feature on CodePen later. 
I've added an additional feature that allows you to reset the slides when you click on the background.

  Second day - Drag and Drop.
The second project of the marathon has already been uploaded to CodePen.

  Third day - Slaider.
I have now added some CSS lines to the projects.
The third project is done
So, Day 3 is coming to an end.
I have added some functions to slider. (1:05)
I have now added a function that allows you to switch slides using buttons < >
Check new changes!

  Fourth day - Board.
The fourth project is already on CodePen, but the day is not over yet =>

  Fifth day - Aim Traning.
It's actually the Fourth day.
No you didn't oversleep the day. I made the decision to shorten the marathon and the fifth project is already on my CodePen.
You can offer a CS2 player to test aim training.
Now, when you click on the circle, different colors will appear.
You can add glow elements
circle.style.boxShadow = `0 0 2px ${color}, 0 0 10px ${color}`; after setting the color

When someone views my projects, I'll post a few additional features
I'll post my opinion on the projects later.
I have added some functions to Aim Training. (1:09)
Added the "Play Again" button.
Can I publish a "script" on Aim Training?
This function can be easily implemented, but CodePen does not allow it to work. If you want to use the winTheGame function, download the code on VSCode (copy the code from my CodePen), open the website through the Live Server, and run the function in the page console.

  So, the 5-day marathon is coming to an end. Today, I've been improving my projects. If I make any changes, I'll post updates on github. (I'm not saying goodbye yet.)
  All the images for the projects were taken from unsplash.
  If I participate in code marathons, I will write here
